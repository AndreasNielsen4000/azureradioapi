        We would like to develop a speaker system based on the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 will allow audio
        to be streamed from a Bluetooth device, like a smartphone, or to be streamed from the internet using WiFi.
        The system allows multiple speakers to be wirelessly connected to play audio in stereo. The speakers should
        work well as bookshelf speakers, but they should also be portable, and completely wireless. The speakers
        can be powered by built in Li-Ion batteries, or by a USB-PD capable power supply. The speaker cabinet will
        be 3D-Printed, and all electronics will be contained on two custom circuit boards. A backend server will be
        used to control and monitor the speaker system.
