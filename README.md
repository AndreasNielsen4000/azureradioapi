# Azure Radio API

## Concept

The Azure Radio API is a web application that provides a RESTful API for accessing radio station data. We will use the API to build a radio station directory that allows users to play radio stations from urls. 

## Getting Started

To run the Azure Radio API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/azureradioapi.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd azureradioapi
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

5. Access the API:

    Once the server is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.
